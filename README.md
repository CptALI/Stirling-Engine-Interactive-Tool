# Stirling-Engine-Interactive-Tool
This tool is made to help understanding the complexity of the Stirling engines and to follow the processes on thermodynamic diagrams. 
Based on the diagrams and figures in: "Urieli and D. M. Berchowitz, Stirling cycle engine analysis. Bristol: A. Hilger, 1984."

A seperate executable is created using PyInstaller.
